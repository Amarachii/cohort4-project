## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello there,
this is my Final capstone project for HerTechTrail cohort 4.

## The challenge

The challenge faced was editing this template to my style and taste.It was a great challenge because the code is a bulky one.
I however changed most parts of the HTML, edited the stylings and overall made it a new website of mine.

## Users are able to:

You as a viewer can view this website on any device as I made the site responsive to any screen size,
Visit any of my social media platforms via the links provided in the icons,
View the hosted page of my projects in the portfolio page by clicking on the name title beneath the picture and also visit my github account by clicking the github icon.

## Building project

What went into building this project was:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Bootstrap

## Deploying project

I deployed my project to netlify.
