## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello there,
this is my Final capstone project for HerTechTrail cohort 4.

The challenge faced was editing this template to my style and taste and it was a great challenge.
I added new things in HTML and edited the stylings in the CSS as well.

## Users are able to:

View this website on any device as I made the site responsive to any screen size,
Visit any of my social media platforms via the links provided in the icons,
Notice the hover effect on the links and image{increase in size}.
